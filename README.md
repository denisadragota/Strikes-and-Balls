# Strikes-and-Balls
Mastermind game : Guess your opponent's 3 numbers!
  
A simple Guessing Game designed for 2 players with multiple rounds. 
This was an extra credit project for school. I used OllyDbg, a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger. 
- Game Rules:

The first player introduces 3 numbers.
The second player tries multiple times to guess the 3 numbers in the right order.
'Strike'- means that a number was guessed on the right position.
'Ball'- means that a number was guessed, but on a wrong position.

After each try, the second player gets his count of strikes and balls, and he can adjust his choices
-3 strikes means that the second player has completely guessed the numbers. A message with the needed number tries is displayed.
The player is asked if he wants to begin a new round.
